The team had a great first qualifier of the season, especially considering we are a rookie team. This was our first time ever participating. Not only was it incredibly fun but we learned a lot about our robot, its design and how to present our work to a group of judges.

In the qualifying rounds, our robot went 3-3, and we were ranked 6th out of the 11 teams at the event. This was great considering Kellen, our driver, didn't have any driving experience prior to the event.

When it was time for alliance selection, we were chosen by team #8909 FLCS Falcons, another rookie team, (ranked 2nd after the qualifying rounds) to be part of their alliance! We then won both of our semi-final rounds together; however, we ended up losing both of the final rounds due to some penalties.

We also received the Judge's Award in recognition of the uniqueness, dynamics, and performance of our team!

What a great first qualifier!
