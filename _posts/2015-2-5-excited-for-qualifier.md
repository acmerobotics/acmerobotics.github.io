We are super excited for our qualifier coming up this weekend! Our new iteration of roadrunner is coming along nicely.

Kellen has been working diligently on a new driving system that will allow more control for the robot and more traction. He has also been creating a acrylic shell to protect the robot. Ryan has been working on our autonomous code and we have very reliable code for knocking down the kickstand as well as driving off the ramp. Charlotte has been keeping up with all of the documentation and we should have a pretty neat engineering notebook to show the judges.

We absolutely cannot wait to compete in the next qualifier! Crossing our fingers that we'll do well.
