The team started off the qualifying rounds strong with a win in our first match. However, this luck was short-lived; the team ended up losing the rest of the qualifying rounds (mostly due to penalties). After the rounds, we were ranked 14th.

Nevertheless, during alliance selection, the 2nd ranked team, team #8375 Vulcan Robotics, choose us to be a part of their alliance instead of the 1st ranked team. Thanks to them, we then had a shot at moving on to the NorCal regional championships!

After that, our alliance won each of our matches in the semifinals and the finals.

In addition to being part of the winning alliance, the team received the Judge's Award. We're really excited to move on to the NorCal championships! Go Acme!!
