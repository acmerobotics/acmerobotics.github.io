We won a 3d printer from EKOcycle and it has just recently arrived. We are super excited to be able to
print things!

We wrote a 300 word essay about our team and how the printer would help us. EKOcycle promotes the use of
recycled plastic and therefore much of their cartridges were made from recycled plastic. Being a rookie
team having a 3D printer is very very exciting. We are now able to custom-make parts for our robot as
well as giveaways for the competitions.
