We won a 3d printer from EKOCYCLE with Coca Cola and it has just recently arrived. We are super excited to be able to print things!

EKOCYCLE promotes the use of recycled plastic and therefore much of their cartridges were made from recycled plastic. Being a rookie team having a 3D printer is very very exciting. We are now able to custom-make parts for our robot as well as giveaways for the competitions.

The printer is an EKOCYCLE Cube printer. We had to apply by writing and submitting a 300 word essay on why our team needs a printer and why we want this specific one. Sponsored by coca cola and will.i.am, we won it virtually free.

It is incredible to be able to do what we love, and make cool plastic stuff as well as help to reuse the abundance of plastic waste we are producing.

We cannot wait to see what we can do with this!!
