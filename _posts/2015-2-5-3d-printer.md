We received an EKOCYCLE Cube 3D printer free of cost as part of a grant sponsored by Coca-Cola and 3D Systems.

The printer uses recycled plastic for prints; it is very environment-friendly. The team is very excited to receive the printer because it allows us to make custom parts for our robot.

In order to get the printer, the team completed an online application that included the submission of a 300-word essay about how we would use the printer. We are very excited to see what we can make with this new tool!
