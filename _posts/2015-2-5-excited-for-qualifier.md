We are super excited for our qualifier coming up this weekend! Our new iteration of Roadrunner is coming along nicely.

Kellen has been working diligently on a new driving system that will allow more control for the robot and more traction. He has also been creating a acrylic shell to protect the robot.

Ryan has been working diligently on the autonomous code. As a result, the robot can now consistently knock over the kickstand regardless of its position.

Charlotte has been working on finalizing our engineering notebook and working on the website.

We cannot wait to compete in the next qualifier! We're hoping that we'll do well and advance to the NorCal state championship!
