Everybody loves a comeback story, right? Well here is the king of them.

Team Acme started out the qualifier with a win. The next three matches hit us hard. We lost them all due to penalties and unlucky alliance partners, but by the time of the semifinals and finals we had it all figured out. Sadly, we were ranked 14th.

During the alliance selection we were picked by one of the highest ranked teams: #8375 Vulcans, despite our low ranking. This was partially due to our speed and agility as well as our compatibility with a robot that has such a reliable and functional lifting mechanism.

Team Vulcan and us came in first and consequently have been invited to the Norcal Regional Championship!

We also received the Judge's Award, again, in recognition of the uniqueness, dynamics, and performance of our team!

We had so much fun and we absolutely cannot wait for the Championship!!
